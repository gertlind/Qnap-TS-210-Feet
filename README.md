# Qnap-TS-210-Feet
STL for Qnap TS-210 standing feets.

The rubber feets on my old Qnap TS-210 have slowly given up over the years.
Designed new ones in Fusion360 and printed them on my Original Prusa MK2 in TPU.

Since it is difficult with support and flex materials a small cut is needed to the lips on one side.

See drawing.
